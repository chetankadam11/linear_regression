# linear_regression
- Linear regression is a popular and widely used statistical modeling technique for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent 
  variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable.

## Analysing the above model, the comapany should focus on the following features:
- Company should focus on expanding business during Spring.
- Company should focus on expanding business during September.
- Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to 2019.
- There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes without having business impact.

#### Hence when the situation comes back to normal, the company should come up with new offers during spring when the weather is pleasant and also advertise a little for September as this is when business would be at its best.
## _`Conclusion`_

- hum
- windspeed
- Season
- months(January, July, September, November, December)
